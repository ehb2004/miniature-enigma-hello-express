# The Importance of Handoffs 🤝

## Personal Experience with Handoffs
Setting up my first full-stack Node.js app was daunting. With so many moving pieces, it quickly became evident that I was in dire need of some way to keep track of all of the work I was doing. 
This became increasingly evident upon realizing how hard it is to leave work at 5pm on a Friday to come back to what looks like a spew of code at 8am on a Monday.

One specific moment that stands out to me is when I was creating a web-based application for tracking issues as they arose in our IT department. I had no idea that the sheer magnitude of code, and files, and changes would quickly
become overwhelming to handle. I found myself struggling to leave work overnight and not understand what I was working on the next morning. In order to mitigate the effects of the lostness I was feeling, I started to make use 
of a handy notebook which I used to keep track of everything that I had completed previously as well as what the next steps should be. 

This notebook became absolutely essential to finish coding my application. Had I not used such notes, the project easily could have take twice the amount of time that it did. 

## So What is a Handoff? 🤔
According to [Software Finder](https://softwarefinder.com/resources/project-handoff), a **project handoff** is:
> "any project transfer from one team, division, or company to another."

However, handoffs are not exclusive to teams. A handoff can also be to your **future self**. This helps you, the developer, to ensure that youare able to quickly resume work where you left off rather than scrambling with all of the pieces.

When creating a handoff for yourself or others, it is important to remember key steps to create a more seamless handoff. According to [ProjectManagement](https://www.projectmanagement.com/articles/883864/3-ways-to-help-ensure-a-seamless-project-handoff),
these steps are:
- Documenting **key** events throughout the project.
- Walking through the details of a project with the appropriate teams.
- Setting up time to assist _after_ the project handoff.

**So what's the big idea here?**
The [Interaction Design Foundation](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-handoffs?srsltid=AfmBOorKKbR26Lnzq-4nYDAIO5jg0kocOl09KSYWe160byuGajCGnc3D) states that handoffs are immensely important because of several reasons.
The first of these reasons is that a proper handoff helps to prevent **misundestandings** which is crucial with any project. So much valuable time is save with proper documentation provided by a handoff. Additionally, the article states that a good handoff can help prevent
rework which saves on time and frustration for developers. 

All in all, whether you are writing a handoff to your colleagues or just yourself, they are a crucial aspect of Agile development.
